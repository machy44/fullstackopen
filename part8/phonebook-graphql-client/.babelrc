// @babel/preset-env ->which syntax transforms(and optionally, browser polyfills) are needed
// by your target envs. You can setup what browsers to support
// @babel/preset-typescript -> typescript compiler is capable of transpiling your code
// but it is not as flexible, powerful and complete as Babel
