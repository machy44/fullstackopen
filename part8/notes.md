# a) graphql server

Let's consider the following example: our bloglist application contains some kind of social media functionality, and we would like to show a list of all the blogs that were added by users who have commented on any of the blogs we follow.

If the server implemented a REST API, we would probably have to do multiple HTTP requests from the browser before we had all the data we wanted. The requests would also return a lot of unnecessary data, and the code on the browser would probably be quite complicated.

If this was an often-used functionality, there could be a REST endpoint for it. If there were a lot of these kinds of scenarios however, it would become very laborious to implement REST endpoints for all of them. 

A GraphQL server is well-suited for these kinds of situations. 

Despite its name, GraphQL does not actually have anything to do with databases. It does not care how the data is saved. The data a GraphQL API uses can be saved into a relational database, document database, or to other servers which a GraphQL server can access with for example REST.
